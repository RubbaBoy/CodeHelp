## Overview
CodeHelp is an Intellij plugin for helping out any user who often forgets how to use something and end up googling for the same example every time,  or just wants to look for how to use something within the ease of their own IDE. The best part about CodeHelp is the fact that any user can contribute code snippets to the CodeHelp database (After being accepted) which everyone can use when they restart their IDE.

## Installation

## Usage
When you boot up your IDE, click the side toolbar on "CodeHelp".

After the system checks for updates and downloads any available snippets, you can either search a tag on the left search bar of the window, or browse the snippet tree.

To save a snippet for later easy retrieval, click the star on the top right of the snippet to bookmark it. These bookmarked items are all in the bookmark section to the left of the snippet tree. To view extra info on the snippet, click the "?" as shown in the screenshot.

## Contributing yourself
Contributing to the database of snippets is extremely easy. All that is needed is make a pull request to the [GitHub for the snippets](https://github.com/RubbaBoy/CodeHelpSnippets/), in the same path that will be displayed in the snippet tree in the plugin. For formatting of the snippet, follow the [template](https://rubbaboy.me/code/o5998o6?lang=markdown). You can have as many or as few code snippets, tags, and references, but will require a description for each code block, the code being any language supported by GitHub. If your snippet is in the wrong format, it will not be accepted and you will be notified of what is wrong and how to fix it. Once myself (RubbaBoy) merges your pull request, it will be pushed to the database within around a day. You will be notified once the snippet is in the database, and all is needed left is for you to restart your IDE and use the plugin.
